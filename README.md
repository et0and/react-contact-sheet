# react-contact-sheet

React webapp intended for making printable contact sheets locally.

This project is a convenience wrapper around `react-photo-gallery` for the sole purpose of viewing a large set of uniformly sized / shaped images as part of a creative review worklow. I simply found viewing these images in a file browser insufficient due to the un-necessary styling, spacing and meta information.

## How to Use

1. Run it locally - `npm run dev`
2. Copy jpg / png files into the `/public` folder
3. Edit the `Config.js` file to match the image's aspect ratio width and height
4. View the results!

That's it, nothing fancy. Enjoy!
